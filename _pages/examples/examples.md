# Basic Examples

The basic [tutorial](tutorial) describes how to build a simple, but full 
fledged example app ([see source code](https://github.com/VirtualLab/tutorial).)
Take a look at this app as a working starting point for something you can 
deploy online.

# Research Projects

Although studies of individual behavior are desirable and easy to build, the 
virtual lab really shines for studying groups, especially for complex 
interactions or social behavior among many people over time. Here are some 
projects that have been built on TurkServer: 
    
## Crisis Mapping 

> Mao, Andrew, Winter Mason, Siddharth Suri, and Duncan J. Watts. **An experimental study of team size and performance on a complex task.** PloS one 11, no. 4 (2016): e0153048.

In this project, we use a real-time Meteor app built on TurkServer to 
experimentally study and analyze collaboration and coordination with 
respect to teams of varying size on a highly dynamic [crisis mapping][4] task.

## Long-run Cooperation
 
> Publication forthcoming. 

[This project][5] allows a hundred people to interact in a prisoners' dilemma 
experiment, conducted daily over a *month*, collecting an order of magnitude
 more data than past studies.
