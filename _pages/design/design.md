# Designing Good Experiments

While TurkServer provides much of the software components necessary
for deploying web-based experiments, there is still a great deal that
is helpful to know to ensure that your study goes smoothly and workers
leave happy.

When doing multi-Turker (i.e. 2 or more users) experiments using Meteor, there
are a number of important considerations that need to be factor into
experimental design and when HITs are launched live.

The lab at [Microsoft Research
NYC](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/newyork/) aims to pioneer the
development of web-based behavioral experiments, and you should feel free to
contact [Andrew Mao](http://www.andrewmao.net/) or [Sid
Suri](http://www.sidsuri.com/) with questions about your experimental design.

As design of web-based experiments is a quickly changing landscape, we
hope to update this section in the future with links to a more
comprehensive tutorial.
