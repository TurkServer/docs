Meteor already makes it pretty easy to design a reactive and responsive user interface, but you may find some of the following packages useful.

- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), a CSS framework for front-end development.
- [Tutorials](https://github.com/mizzao/meteor-tutorials), a Meteor-specific tutorials package that I wrote for providing interactive and concise instructions for web apps. Very useful for delivering easily digestible experiment instructions.
