> I don't want to or can't write code. Can I hire a developer to build my web
 application (experiment) for me? 

In theory, yes. **But there are many issues that can arise when this is 
process is poorly managed.** Here are some important ones. 

A primary issue is the process of taking a research question and
operationalizing it. In other words, when you build an experiment, you have a
particular question in mind (*or at least you should!*) and you are building an
app to collect data to answer that question. This process invariably requires
feedback, revision, and modification when you find that the original plan 
doesn't answer the question as well as you thought.
  
In contrast, software development often follows specifications that are a priori
much more concrete than research projects, and most developers will be much more
productive working from a spec rather than the more unstructured research
process in continually revising how the implementation of the user interface
answers the research question. This leads to potential errors in translation in
going from the question at hand to how it is implemnted, and the constant
revisions to the original plan could result in the project taking a long time.
But the real danger is in this frustration leading to giving up on doing things
correctly, which will result in a poorly designed experiment with questionable
data. **As a community, we should ensure that reducing barriers to doing
experiments doesn't result in many low-quality experiments.**

The other main aspect to consider is that running an experiment is not simply
about having the software, but also the protocol of the experimenter and
interaction with the participants. There is much less variation than in
traditional brick-and-mortar experiments, as much of this is encapsulated in the
software. However, there are still exceptions, a notable one being the
importance of [engaging with workers and maintaining your
reputation](forums-reputation). As a result, it's very difficult to run a
software-based experiment without understanding how the user interface and the
rest of the app was built. Either you'll need to be familiar with it anyway, or
your developer will also need to be a "lab manager" and run the experiment.

For all these reasons, I strongly suggest having a computer scientist or 
technically-inclined person as part of the research teamâ€”or at the very 
least, for such a person to work closely with a developer. Otherwise, make 
sure your developer understands the question you're trying to answer, what 
you're trying to do in the experiment, and what will be necessary to run the 
experiment successfully.
