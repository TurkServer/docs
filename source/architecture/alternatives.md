There are many other platforms released by academics for doing online 
experiments. Here are a list of the ones we know that are currently active.

The main differentiation of TurkServer is relative to the platforms and
frameworks below is its focus on facilitating and instrumenting real-time and
synchronous interaction. But we've kept the software simple, and you'll find 
features such as the [live experimenter console](admin-console) and [one-way 
mirror](mirror) useful even for single-user experiments.

- [Breadboard][breadboard] focuses on network and cooperation experiments.
- [CogniLab][cognilab] is a paid service for launching online experiments, no
 coding required.
- [NodeGame][nodegame] is (also) a Javascript library for real-time experiments.   
- [oTree][otree] is a Django (Python) based framework focusing on economic 
games. 
- [PsiTurk][psiturk] is a Python-based framework for building and sharing
experiments, originating in the psychology community.
- [Volunteer Science][vs] is a hosted platform that maintains their own 
volunteer panel.

Unless using volunteer participants, all of the aforementioned software 
frameworks run on crowdsourcing platforms:
 
- [Amazon Mechanical Turk][mturk] has been around the longest and is 
currently the most widely used.
- [Prolific Academic][prolific] is a recently launched framework focusing on 
academic research.
- See [this Quora question][crowdsourcing] for other crowdsourcing systems 
that may supplement or replace Mechanical Turk in the future.
