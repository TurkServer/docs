Best crowdsourcing practices: 
http://wiki.wearedynamo.org/index.php/Guidelines_for_Academic_Requesters

- Treat workers like people. They have a community, and talk to each other.
- Active worker forums
- Monitor your reputation on [TurkOpticon][to]. A good reputation means that 
you will be able to recruit more workers and they will be more diligent.
