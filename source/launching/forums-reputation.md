# Working with Workers

- Treat workers like people. They have a community, and talk to each other.
- Workers are [active on many forums][ygsv16]. They communicate there, and you can communicate with them!
- Monitor your reputation on [TurkOpticon][to]. A good reputation means that 
you will be able to recruit more workers and they will be more diligent.
- [WeAreDynamo] is a community of workers aiming to improve practices on MTurk.  
- Consider [best practices][bp] for crowdsourcing.
