## Basic Examples

The basic [tutorial](tutorial) describes how to build a simple, but full 
fledged example app ([see source code](https://github.com/TurkServer/tutorial).)
Take a look at this app as a working starting point for something you can 
deploy online.

## Research Projects

Although studies of individual behavior are desirable and easy to build, 
TurkServer really shines for studying groups, especially for complex
interactions or social behavior among many people over time. For ideas,
inspiration, or just examples, take a look at some [research projects](research)
that have been built using TurkServer.
