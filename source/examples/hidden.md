# Research Projects

Since the 1950s, social scientists of all disciplines have been studying 
people in "behavioral labs" at universities. These labs typically involve 
cramming a group of people into a room for an hour or so and asking them to 
do something:

The lab is quite a useful tool in that it offers a great degree of control in
doing experiments, and hence the ability to draw correct, causal conclusions.
But there are clear limitations of using such an environment to study 
practically *all* of human behavior:  

- it's a pretty **artificial environment**
- the setup generally supports only **simple tasks**
- subjects are **[very homogeneous university undergraduates][1]**
- we can only take a **limited number of people** and keep them there for a 
**short amount of time**
- lab experiments are **expensive**, **difficult to set up**, and **hard to 
replicate**

# Why the Virtual Lab?

The "Virtual Lab" refers to using software-controlled experiments with 
Internet participants to overcome many of the limitations of brick-and-mortar
 lab experiments. We can now study more complex tasks and set up interactions 
 that happen over longer periods of time or among larger numbers of people. 
 This allows us to design behavioral experiments that would have been very 
 hard to do in the past.

## Public goods with communication

> Publication forthcoming.

This [public goods game][pgg-meteor] uses TurkServer to study different
conditions where users can communicate or interact with each other in addition
to choosing how much to contribute.
