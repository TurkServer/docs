# Assignment and Matching

### Matching Issues:

- It's important to make sure Turkers aren't waiting an inordinate amount of time for another user to arrive before the experiment starts
- While this doesn't happen too often, it **will** happen at least 10% of the time **especially** if your HIT has been live for a while 
- One solution is to monitor the amount of the time a user has spent in the lobby and if it exceeds some threshold, push them to the TS Exit survey and pay them for their time (e.g. half the HIT amount)
    - This sucks because we have to pay for 0 data, but we can write it off as the cost of saving lab reputation 
* Another solution for users that do wait an exceedingly long time and eventually complete your experiment is to pay them a bonus for being patient

- When running really large groups, schedule people in advance.
