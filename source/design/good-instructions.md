# Providing Good Instructions

When running experiments with crowdsourcing systems, users benefit greatly from
good instructions and will be more attentive to the task. Poorly worded or
incomprehensible instructions will result in bad quality data. The [tutorials][tutorials]
package for Meteor was written alongside TurkServer to provide interactive instructions for
how to use a Meteor app, with this use case in mind.

When giving instructions, ensure that participants will understand your
experiment and can't simply "click through" to get paid. A good way to filter
out this kind of behavior is to provide comprehension questions that prevent a
user from advancing or moving past a certain point in your meteor app without
understanding the task. The tutorials package makes it easier to implement these
ideas.

For more information, see the documentation for the [tutorials] package.
